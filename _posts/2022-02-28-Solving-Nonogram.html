            Constraint solvers are powerful tools to solve combinatorial problems, even difficult optimization problems
            in machine learning. However, to encode a problem to be solved into pure first-order logic can be difficult
            and counterintuitive in a regular imperative programming context like Python.

        <p>
            Here I want to summarize some of my insights while coding in <a href='https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3'>Z3 Theorem Prover</a>, 
            an SMT solver created by Microsoft. In particular, I'll describe how to use Z3 to solve Nonogram puzzles and my thought process.

        <h2>Nonograms</h2>
        <p>
            Nonogram puzzles are a type of number/logic puzzles like Sudoku. The puzzle is presented as a grid. Before
            each row/column is a sequence of numbers denoting the number of consecutive filled squares in that
            row/column in that order. Consecutive filled squares are separated by at least one empty square. We will
            call these numbers as constraints for each row/column.

            <h4>An Example Nonogram Puzzle with Solution</h4>
        </div>
        </p>

        <h2>Solve Nonogram with Z3</h2>
        <p>
            The general steps I take to solve a problem with Z3:
            <ol>
                <li>Create variables that describe the solution of the problem</li>
                <li>Generate constraints for each variable that are obvious in the problem (ie. constraints with only
                    constant terms)</li>
                <li>Generate constraints that involve multiple variables</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Step 1 - Create Variables</h2>
        <p>
            In any Nonogram puzzle, the solution can be represented as a subset of all the squares which are filled
            black. Since the row and column number is known beforehand, a naive approach would be to create one boolean
            variable for each square denoting whether that square is filled black or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            This representation works but it is not an efficient encoding of the solution because we are only concerned
            with squares that are filled. If such encoding were to used, it would take Z3 a long time to solve for large
            Nonogram puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
        A better encoding would be to only create variables for each filled squares. However, an even better approach is
        to create only one variables for each consecutive filled square sequence. For example, if a row has constraint
        <icode>1,3,2</icode>, we would create variables <icode>v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,v<sub>2</sub></icode>. Each
        of them represents the column number <icode>v<sub>x</sub></icode> from which a sequence of <icode>x</icode>
        squares are filled horizontally in the final solution. We create such variables for every row and column
        constraints to get two 2-d matrices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such an encoding greatly reduces the variable space as to make the solving process efficient. In the worst
            case, this process creates at most <icode>m&middot;n/2</icode> variables (ie. a Nonogram with the
            checkerboard pattern), where <icode>m</icode> and <icode>n</icode> are the sizes of the puzzle.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2 - Constant Constraints</h2>
        <p>
            For each variable, its value is bounded by either constant <icode>m</icode> or <icode>n</icode>. We generate
            constraints for those
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, within each row/column, <icode>v<sub>x</sub>+x+1 &le; v<sub>y</sub></icode> given <icode>
                v<sub>y</sub></icode> appears after <icode>v<sub>x</sub></icode>. This inequality encodes the fact that
            every pair of consecutive filled square sequence must have at least one empty-square gap in between. It also
            encodes the order in which consecutive square sequences appear in that row/column.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because <icode>x</icode> and <icode>y</icode> are constants in this case, they are constant constraints.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3 - Variable Constraints</h2>
        <p>
            The final set of constraints links row and column constraints together and it requires a little bit of
            engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conceptually this set of constraints should guarantee that row and column constraints are consistent. More
            specifically, if square <icode>(row=1,col=3)</icode> is required to be filled by a row constraint, then the
            column constraint for column 3 must also require the same square to be filled.
        </p>
        <p>
            To encode this relationship directly is very difficult and less ideal. Both sides of the equality are
            variables and finding the correct variables for each side involves using the existential quantifier, which
            slows down the solving process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's shift the perspective and consider what constraints are required for a square to be filled. A square
            can only be filled if both row constraint and column constraint says so. In other words, square <icode>
                (row=1,col=3)</icode> is filled if the row constraint for row 1 requires column 3 to be filled, and the
            column constraint for column 3 requires row 1 to be filled.
        </p>
        <p>
            This relationship is much easier to encode into logical formulas, since row and column constraints now tie
            to a single concrete square instead of each other.
        </p>
